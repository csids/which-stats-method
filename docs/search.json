By the end of this course, students will be able to identify appropriate statistical methods for a variety of circumstances.\nThis course will not teach students how to implement these statistical methods. The aim of this course is to enable the student to identify which methods are required for their study, allowing the student to identify their needs for subsequent methods courses, self-learning, or external help.\nYou should take this course if you are one of the following:\nThis course covers the following scenarios:"

In statistical testing we have a null hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_0\\)) and an alternative hypothesis (\\(\\text{H}_1\\)). We assume the null hypothesis is true and try to find the probability of what we have observed (or something more extreme). If our observations are very unlikely (assuming the null hypothesis is true) then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\nFor example:\n\\[\\text{H}_0: \\text{It is summer}\\] \\[\\text{H}_1: \\text{It is not summer}\\]\nOur observed data for today is a maximum temperature of -20C. Assuming it is summer, how likely is it that today’s maximum temperature will be -20C? Not very likely!

That is, if a person has their weight measured five times, then just by knowing their first weight you can have a good guess at what their subsequent weights will be.\n\n\n5.1.4 Matched data\nInside case-control studies, for each case a control (or multiple cases) can be selected to have similar attributes. For example, for each case, a control can be selected with a similar age. These controls have been “matched” to a case, and have introduced dependencies into the data.\n\n\n5.1.5 Grouped/clustered data\nRepeated measures data is a type of clustered data, where each person is their own cluster. Matched data is also a type of clustered data, where each group of matched controls-to-a-case is a cluster.\nThere can be many other kinds of clusters, for example:\n\nData sampled from multiple hospitals could have the hospital as the cluster variable\nData sampled from multiple countries could have the country as the cluster variable\nData sampled from multiple counties/municipalities could have the country/municipality as the cluster variable\nIf it is a study of children, and multiple children from each mother are included, then the mother could be the cluster variable"

    "text": "5.2 Analysing data with dependencies\n\n5.2.1 Mixed effects regression\nMixed effects regression is an extension of the simple regression models (fixed effects) that we learned about in the previous chapter. You can have:\n\nMixed effects linear regression\nMixed effects logistic regression\nMixed effects negative-binomial regression\n\nMixed effects models are models that have both fixed and random effects. “Effects” is the term used to describe the estimated impact a variable has on the outcome. For example, “the effect of smoking on the risk of lung cancer”.\nTo determine if an effect is fixed or random, we introduce the concept of pooling data (i.e. sharing strength). Let us assume we have sampled 100 people per city for 9 cities, and 2 people for 1 city, and we want to estimate the average height in each city, we can do one of the following three options:\n\nWithin each city, take the average height of the 100 (or 2) sampled people (zero pooling)\nTake the average height of 1000 sampled people and say each city is the same height (complete pooling)\nEstimate how much the average height varies between the cities. If the average height doesn’t vary much, give estimates close to #2. If the average height varies a lot, give estimates close to #1 (partial pooling)\n\nZero pooling tends to work well when you have a limited amount of effects you want to estimate, each with a good sample size (i.e. you don’t need to borrow strength from other data points). Partial pooling tends to work well when you have a large number of effects you want to estimate, each with a small sample size (i.e. you need to borrow strength from other data points).\nFixed effects are estimated with zero pooling. Random effects are estimated with partial pooling.\nWith data that has a large number of clusters, the clustering need to be accounted for in the regression model. This is done by introducing a variable that uniquely identifies each cluster, and allows the cluster effect to be estimated (e.g. in Oslo people are 1% more likely to die than in the rest of Norway). If there are a large number of clusters with a small amount of people in each cluster, then the cluster variable should be estimated using partial pooling (i.e. random effects).\nIn summary: Mixed effects regression should be used for grouped/clustered/matched data (and subsequently repeated measures/longitudinal data).\n\n\n5.2.2 Conditional logistic regression\nConditional logistic regression can also be used for matched data with a binary outcome, however, it is less flexible than mixed effects regression."

    "text": "7.6 Compliance with boil water advisories and perception of risks\nScenario:\n\nIn this study, the compliance and perception of risks among the public with boil water advisories (BWAs) will be examined.\nAlthough BWAs is a common practice among water utilities, a meta-study suggest that there is limited information and studies on the compliance of BWAs.\nThis part, the compliance and perception of risks will be done by studying the perception of and adherence to BWAs among the consumers of drinking water in Bærum municipality.\nEven though the drinking water in Bærum is considered to have good quality, Bærum – like many water works – experience situations of pressure drops due to breaks and maintenance.\nResearch has shown that these situations may lead to an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections, and due to this the municipality of Bærum has issued a precautionary BWAs to the affected consumers with every water outage during the last 5-6 years.\nEvery year, some 12,000-22,000 consumers have received a precautionary BWA.\nThe purpose of these precautionary BWAs is to prevent health consequences caused by possible contamination of water. However, we know little about the consumer’s knowledge about why they receive these BWAs, as well as the way the consumers perceive and adhere to these BWAs.\nThis is a cross-sectional study.\nA web-survey will be presented to a randomly selected sample of consumers who received a BWA in Bærum in 2017.\nThe web-survey asks about adherence (yes/no) and demographics (e.g. age, sex, income)\n\nQuestion: Estimate adherence by demographics (and identify if it differs by demographics)\nAim: Estimation and hypothesis testing\nOutcome: Binary (adhberence yes/no)\nExposure: Binary (sex), Categorical (age, income)\nParametric assumptions: None\nDependencies: No (“randomly selected sample of consumers”)\nAppropriate Method: Logistic regression"
